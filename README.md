# Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Decision Tree Regressor** using Python. It includes data preprocessing, model training, visualization of the decision tree, and evaluation of model performance. The project is designed to help understand the fundamentals of supervised machine learning.

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handles data cleaning, encoding, and splitting into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**:
   - From Scratch implementation
3. **Visualization**:
   - Generates a graphical representation of the decision tree structure.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Measures the model's accuracy using a testing dataset.
